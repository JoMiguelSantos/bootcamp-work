# Bootcamp Work

This is all the little exercises I've done at the Full Stack Bootcamp at Spiced Academy while learning the taught concepts.

Most of these are very small exercises but if you wanna take a look at a few I'd recommend cloning the repo and running `cd node/handle-express && node .` on the terminal and open your browser on `http://localhost:8080` where you'll find a very basic display of slightly bigger and meaningful projects to look at like a rendition of the famous Connect Four game.

Bigger projects will be in separate repositories so take a look at those for a more meaningful sample of my work.
